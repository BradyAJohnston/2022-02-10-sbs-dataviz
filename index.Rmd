## R Knowledge Rollercoaster

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/r_rollercoaster.png" alt="An illustrated cartoon graph with ‚ÄúHow much I think I know about R‚Äù on the y-axis, with axis labels at ‚ÄúI know nothing‚Äù and ‚ÄúI know lots‚Äù, versus ‚Äútime‚Äù on the x-axis. The line varies widely between the two. Above the line are emoji-like faces, showing uncertainty and hope early on. At a second peak is the label ‚Äújoin R community on twitter‚Äù, with a ‚Äúmind-blown‚Äù emoji face. The line quickly descends, but with a happy looking emoji character sliding down it." height="450px">

## What Makes a Good Figure?

.pull-left[

-  Does not misrepresent the data.

- Tells a clear story
  - Straightforward message, easy to read, hard to misinterpret.

- Low cognitive load.
 - The less thinking the better
 - `low_cognitive_load != less_data`

- Accessible
  - Colourblind-friendly, good contrast, accesible font choices
  - Accessible jargon & language choices

## Data Viz Principles - Understanding the Context
.pull-left[

- ###  WHO
  - Who is the audience?

- ###  WHAT
  - What do you need them to know?

- ###  HOW
  - How are you going to communicate your point?

## WHO


 - What is their familiarity with the topic?  
  - Experts in your field, experts not in your field, undergrads, 
  general public


 
 - How much time to do you have?  
  - Published in a paper, in a 5 / 10 / 40 minute talk, a poster



 - Do you need to establish trust?
  - Explain technique? Show previous work?

 -  What is your relationship to them?
  - Lab meeting, school presentation, presentation to public

## Design and Data

#### Good design _reduces_ the cognitive load.

--

>Cognitive load refers to the amount of effort that is exerted or required while
reasoning and thinking. Any mental process, from memory to perception to
language, creates a cognitive load because it requires energy and effort. When
cognitive load is high, thought processes are potentially interfered with.

>_- Interaction Design Foundation_

--

</br>
#### The more you have to .highlight[think] about a figure, the higher the cognitive load.

## Gestalt Principle

- Pre-processing of the information that the brain uses
</br>
- Use these principles to create an _information-heirachy_.

## A Slightly Cleaner Example

answer_levels <- c(
  "What is R? You mean the letter?", 
  'I can run `print("hello world!")`',

  "I've made 'complicated' analysis scripts.",
  "I have created reusable data analysis scripts, for different data sets.",
  "I have created my own R packages.",
  "I am the wealth of all R knowledge, Hadley Wickham asks me perosnally for advice on his pacakges."
)
```


```{r forms-example-plot, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4.5}
df %>% 
  select(ID, `How would you describe (be kind to yourself!) your skill levels in R?`) %>% 
  rename(
    answer = 2
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    answer = factor(answer, levels = answer_levels), 
  ) %>% 
  group_by(answer) %>% 
  count(answer, .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = answer, fill = answer)) + 
  guides(fill = "none") +

  scale_y_discrete(
    breaks = answer_levels, 
    labels = str_wrap(answer_levels, 50)
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1)), 
    breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6)
  ) +
  labs(
    y = "", 
    x = "", 
    title = "1. How would you describe (be kind to yourself!) your skill levels in R?"

## Assemble Whole Figures
.pull-left[

- Stitch together multiple plots, into one figure. [`{Patchwork}`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) takes care of the alignments, lettering and layout.

- _Just Works_.

- Alternatives: [`{cowplot}`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/)
