## R Knowledge Rollercoaster

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/r_rollercoaster.png" alt="An illustrated cartoon graph with “How much I think I know about R” on the y-axis, with axis labels at “I know nothing” and “I know lots”, versus “time” on the x-axis. The line varies widely between the two. Above the line are emoji-like faces, showing uncertainty and hope early on. At a second peak is the label “join R community on twitter”, with a “mind-blown” emoji face. The line quickly descends, but with a happy looking emoji character sliding down it." height="450px">

## Data Viz Principles - Understanding the Context

- ###  WHO
  - Who is the audience?

- ###  WHAT
  - What do you need them to know?

- ###  HOW
  - How are you going to communicate your point?

---

## WHO


 - What is their familiarity with the topic?  
  - Experts in your field, experts not in your field, undergrads, 
  general public


 
 - How much time to do you have?  
  - Published in a paper, in a 5 / 10 / 40 minute talk, a poster



 - Do you need to establish trust?
  - Explain technique? Show previous work?

 -  What is your relationship to them?
  - Lab meeting, school presentation, presentation to public

## Design and Data

Good design reduces the cognitive load.

Bad design increases cognitive load, hides the key message in your data.
